# `keyring` package does not persistently save variables. hence i need to set them as environmental variables.
# can do this by adding environmental variables to `.bashrc`.

vim .bashrc
export PASSWORD='password123'

# can display environmental variables with...

echo $PASSWORD

# it looks like these environmental variables arent loaded into R session on startup. i am instead able to access them if i put them into an '.Renviron' file in my home directory.

vim .Renviron
PASSWORD='password123'
